# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

1.	I've wrote a code for this project into three files namely app.py, database.py and book_rating.py.
2.	Database is needed for every function, so once I created and import its function to jsut execute query.
3.	In app.py, I've wrote the index function; the user_data function will collect the data through form.
4.	Once the data is collected, I store them into a global dict for the choice weather user wants to confirm or 	deny the registration.
5.	Selecting the confirm button will register the users into database.
6.	The registered will be now able to find books and comment on them.
7.	The HTML files I've put inside the `books` folder.
8.	I've used the builtin functions for error handling in this project so that if the user attempts wrong url 		in case of logout, the functions will handle to that.
